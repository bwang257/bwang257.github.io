# My Personal Website: "BrianOS v1.0"
> A high-performance, systems-themed portfolio interface built with React 19.
> Designed to emulate a Tiling Window Manager (i3wm/Pop!_OS) environment.

BrianOS is not a standard scrolling website. It is a **single-page React application** designed to function like a personalized operating system. It features a fully interactive window management system, a functional CLI, and real-time state management for a "desktop" experience.

Note: This page is currently under redesign for readability and clarity in communicating who I am.
